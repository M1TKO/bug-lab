									<p>AdHash is a unique solution when it comes to information storage. Unlike other advertising platforms, networks, or exchanges, AdHash is a decentralised protocol that allows both advertisers and publishers to collect, store, and analyse their data directly on their servers. AdHash therefore does not keep a copy of any detailed ad targeting or performance data. Any personal information collected by advertisers and publishers is contained solely on their servers and is subject to their privacy policies.</p>
									<p>AdHash does not store any personally identifiable information on the blockchain.</p>
